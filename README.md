👋🏾 Hi! I’m Keesha, a vibrant force of curiosity and purpose.

I’m a data storyteller with a heart for impact. Gabonese by roots, global in vision — I blend statistical thinking with business insight to turn numbers into economic growth and social change strategies.  
I help businesses sustain themselves, grow stronger, and build lasting empires, all in the service of driving meaningful impact.

###  What I’m Working On
- Predicting business success in emerging markets using multivariate models  
- Exploring how GDP growth, trade policies, and ease of doing business affect startup survival  
- Using data for **both prediction and inference** to support strategic decision-making

### A Bit More About Me
- Bilingual (French & English), faith-led, and endlessly learning  
- Passionate about making data approachable for beginners  
- Currently teaching and developing content with Cleveland State University and STEM Zone

###  Fun Fact  
Ironically, I used to dread statistics in high school. Now it’s the language I use to teach, solve real-world problems, and help others make more intelligent decisions — and I’m all about it.
